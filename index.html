        <h1>Test the Dendrite Network and Get Up To $1000</h1>
        <h2>I'm conducting a trial run and you can help.</h2>
      </div>

          <h1>Help me find my next client using my <a href="http://phoenixbureau.github.com/DendNet/">Dendrite Network</a> and I'll reward you with up to $1000.</h1>

<p>I want to try out the <a href="http://phoenixbureau.github.com/DendNet/">Dendrite Network</a> and I need your help. In return, if you connect me to my next client through the DN I will give you a finder's fee.  I'll divide $1000.00 between the people in the chain of contacts linking me to my next client.</p>

<h2>How to Participate</h2>

<p>If you don't see some buttons at the top of this page: "Engage", "Forward", and "Reject", then <a href="http://dendritenetwork.com/bump/tlpa3gx03bh7docieg448ca5/33lnkoykqr51ehh6g92g8mx2/">click on this link to revisit this page through the Dendrite Network</a>. You'll see a simple form where you can enter the URL of a website that identifies you. <strong>Be sure there's some way to contact you on that website</strong> otherwise how will I know how to get a hold of you?</p>

<p>It's also a good idea to <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dendrite-network">join the Google Group</a> and post your URL there so I can be sure to know who you are!</p>

<p>So you see the buttons above now, right? Great! Click on <strong>"Forward"</strong> and copy the <em>"Bump URL"</em> and send it along to your contacts.  Tell them what's going on and be respectful, <strong>don't spam people!</strong>  They'll follow the link to this page, hopefully pick their own URL, and your "bump" will register in the DN log.</p>

<p>Because the process of spreading the word about this page is publicly recorded in the log I'll be able to see who's in the chain of connections (think "degrees of Kevin Bacon") when someone becomes my next client.</p>

<h2>Become my Next Client</h2>

<p>I'm a very good programmer, here's <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/simon-forman/16/903/48b">my LinkedIn profile</a>, and <a href="http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/res/3509417162.html">my resume on Craigslist</a>.</p>

<p>Let's make some people very happy, including you and me! Become a client and let computers solve your problems for you!</p>
