 <h1>What I Believe</h1>
 <hr>
<blockquote cite="http://rescomp.stanford.edu/~cheshire/EinsteinQuotes.html">
 <p>&quot;A human being is a part of a whole, called by us <em>universe</em>, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest... a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.&quot;

 <p>The nature of "self" holds the key to an extraordinary and transcendant transformation in what we commonly call our condition.

 <p>The idea that you are your body or your human life is not reflective of the actual conditions apparent to you.  It is an illusion.

 <p>The essence of your own sense of self, of being, is not other than the Self of the whole of the Universe.

 <p>By dint of seeming to exist as this human being on this odd little planet your presence or awareness contains contents.  All phenomenon are contents of awareness. Awareness is content-free. But, quite paradoxically, the contents of your awareness are instrumental in you becoming aware of yourself.  Since I hold "you" to be awareness, I can say that the contents of your awareness are instrumental in awareness becoming aware of itself, or that your life as you live it is an essential aspect of God maintaining the Universe.

 <p>It sounds contradictory, but your temporal life is not other than the Eternal.
 <p>
 <p>The one question it is needful always to ask is, "Who is it that is experiencing the phenomenon?"
 <p>
 <p>No matter the contents of your awareness the self (that is the context for those contents) is there.  By asking always "Who is this that is experiencing?" you can return your awareness to the awareness of awareness and, eventually, realize the Self.

 <p>Because self has no qualities it is impossible to describe.  It is neither hot nor cold, it has no size, and it experiences no passage of time as it is always now, eternal. There are no sides to it and no parts. It has no extent yet there is no place without it.  It cannot be pointed to yet everything in the Universe indicates it.  It is beyond all possible signification, yet it is the signifigance of all acts and events and things.

 <p>It is this indescribable great thing that is your own very essence.  You are not other than that.

 <p>To remember this is the point and purpose of your life.  If you are not seeking you are wasting a very precious chance.  Do not be misled by anything, this life is given you that you may remember who you are and return home. Any other pastime or passion is folly.

 <p>The basics are clear: live simply, be goodly, remember God.
