In return, if you connect me to my next client through the DN I will give you a finder's fee.  I'll divide _$1000.00_ between the people in the chain of contacts linking me to my next client.\r\n\r\n## How to Participate\r\n\r\nIf you don't see some buttons at the top of this page: \"Engage\", \"Forward\", and \"Reject\", then [click on this link to revisit this page through the Dendrite Network](http://dendritenetwork.com/bump/tlpa3gx03bh7docieg448ca5/33lnkoykqr51ehh6g92g8mx2/). You'll see a simple form where you can enter the URL of a website that identifies you. **Be sure there's some way to contact you** otherwise how will I know how to get a hold of you?\r\n\r\n[It's also a good idea to join the Google Group and post your URL there so I can be sure to know who you are!](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/dendrite-network)\r\n\r\nSo you see the buttons above now, right? Great! Click on **\"Forward\"** and copy the _\"Bump URL\"_ and send it along to your contacts.  Tell them what's going on and be respectful, don't spam people!  They'll follow the link to this page and your \"bump\" will register in the DN log.\r\n\r\nBecause the process of spreading this page is recorded in the log I'll be able to see who is in the chain of connections (think \"degrees of Kevin Bacon\") when someone becomes my next client.\r\n\r\n## Become my Next Client\r\n\r\nI'm a very good programmer, here's a [link to my LinkedIn profile](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/simon-forman/16/903/48b), and [my resume on Craigslist](http://sfbay.craigslist.org/sfc/res/3509417162.html).\r\n\r\nLet's make some people very happy, including you and me! Become a client and let computers solve your problems for your!\r\n\r\n> _\"Let the robots do the work and we'll take their pay!\"_"}
